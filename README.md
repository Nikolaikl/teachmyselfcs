This is a simple repository in which I reflect the progress I made on the track of teaching myself Computer Science following https://teachyourselfcs.com. 

The Data Structure and Algorithm module builds on Goodrich, Tamassia and Goldwasser (2013)

The Computer Structure module builds on Abelson's and Sussman's _Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs_. Most of these topics got covered in my Masters and get covered while working on other topics in the field though.

The Computer Systems module builds on the Computer Systems book by Bryant and O'Hallaron (2016)
