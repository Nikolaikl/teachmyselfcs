This is a simple repository in which I reflect the progress I made on the track of teaching myself Computer Science following https://teachyourselfcs.com. 

The Data Strucutre and Algorithm Book builds on Goodrich, Tamassia and Goldwasser (2013)

The Computer Structure module builds on Abelson's and Sussman's _Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs_ 

The Computer Systems builds on the Computer Systems book by Bryant and O'Hallaron (2016)
